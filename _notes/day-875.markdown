1. **Trump admitted that he would accept damaging information about his political opponents from foreign governments if it was offered to him**. He also said he may not alert the FBI if a foreign government contacted him with said information. "I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening," Trump told ABC News. He also rejected the notion that accepting damaging information from a foreign government would constitute election interference. "It's not an interference," he said, "they have information – I think I'd take it." He added that he might alert the FBI "if I thought there was something wrong," but said that he doesn't think the FBI has "enough agents to take care of it."

* **‘Disgraceful’: 2020 Democratic candidates rip Trump for saying he’d take foreign intelligence on political rivals**.

1. **The House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas against former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates**. The committee is demanding that Flynn and Gates provide documents by June 26 and appear to testify before the committee on July 10. The committee says it issued the subpoenas after Flynn and Gates refused to fully cooperate with Congress. Flynn and Gates have both pled guilty to charges related to Russia investigation conducted by Special Council Mueller.

2. **Justice Department officials plan to interview senior CIA officials as part of their probe into the origins of the Russia investigation.** DOJ investigators want to speak with at least one senior counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst, both of whom were involved in the CIA's attempts to understand the Russian campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

3. **Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney used his position to push for the nomination of a federal judge over the objection of White House lawyers.** Mulvaney repeatedly pushed Don McGahn to nominate Halil Suleyman Ozerden to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mulvaney was a groomsman at Ozerden's wedding in 2003 and he supported the judge's nomination long before he joined the White House. His nomination worried some in the White House, partly because so many of his decisions have been overturned on appeal.

4. **Trump still owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in security fees to at least ten U.S. cities.** The Trump campaign has failed to reimburse the cities for public-safety costs associated with his presidential and campaign rallies.
